"simone-biles"	"['“I’m not the next Usain Bolt or Michael Phelps – I’m the first Simone Biles,” said the American gymnastic powerhouse at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games, and her comment struck a chord. Still just 22, Biles is already in an extremely exclusive ‘legendary’ category of Olympians, occupied by the likes of the Jamaican sprinter and American swimmer. She is already the greatest gymnast that ever lived. But she’s also doing it her own way.', 'Biles rose to fame in 2013 – winning two World Championship golds aged just 16, including the all-around title. She followed that with four Worlds golds in 2014 and another four in 2015.', 'By the time Rio 2016 – her first Olympics – rolled around, she was already a superstar and the hottest of hot favourites for the title. She didn’t disappoint: Biles won gold in the all-around, team, vault and floor, and bronze on the beam.', 'Tokyo 2020 will be the opportunity to cement her Olympic legacy. Gymnastic peak young, and it is unknown whether she will want to push herself physically and mentally into another Olympic cycle for Paris 2024. This summer is a key opportunity for Biles to make a remarkable statement. She has the ability to win golds across the board.', 'Her dominance is built on an utter mastery of gymnastic basics: with a tiny 4 foot 8 frame, incredible athletic ability and power, plus a low centre of gravity, she is built to be the ultimate gymnast. Add in supreme levels of hard work, a great imagination when it comes to her craft, and megawatt levels of personality, and she is almost unbeatable.', 'That imagination was on show last year at the World Championships in Stuttgart - at which she won five golds including the all-around title - when she came up with two different new skills which will be named after her in the women’s code of points. Biles wowed fans and judges with a triple twisting double tuck on the floor, and a double twisting double tuck dismount off the balance beam, which had previously only existed in gymnastics fans’ imaginations before Biles made them reality. Perhaps now the world’s most recognisable Olympian, all eyes will be on her to see what she can do in Tokyo.']"
"michael-phelps-ii"	"['Michael Phelps is arguably the greatest Olympian ever. Some might argue that Usain Bolt, Carl Lewis or Nadia Comaneci have a claim. But for sheer numbers of medals claimed, there is a clear, hands-down winner: Michael Phelps. Even given the fact that Phelps practices a sport in which extremely capable athlete can bag golds across different distances and strokes, his feats still blow away those of any other sportsperson.', 'Phelps has 28 medals in total: his 23 gold medals are more than double the count of his nearest rivals, and its not as if other swimmers have accrued silly numbers of medals, either. Apart from Spitz, Matt Biondi (USA, eight golds) and Jenny Thompson (USA, eight golds), no other swimmer worldwide has managed more than six gold medals in total. 23 is astonishing.', 'Phelps was born in Baltimore on June 30, 1985, and got serious with the sport after joining the North Baltimore Aquatic Club. He was raised by mother Deborah, alongside his sisters Hilary and Whitney, after his parents divorced.', 'A prodigy at his sport, he went to Sydney 2000 aged just 15 –the youngest man in the USA team for an Olympic Games in 68 years). He came close to the podium only in the 200m butterfly, where he finished fifth. From then on, he would dominate the next four Games, finishing the most decorated athlete at every one. In Athens he won six gold medals and two bronzes, falling just short of Mark Spitz’s world record (seven golds at Munich 1972).', 'Beijing 2008 would see the greatest ever medal haul by a single athlete in an Olympic Games. Phelps won eight golds – every event he entered – and broke World Records in seven of them. His record looks unlikely to be surpassed any time soon.', 'London 2012 was also astonishing – he got four golds and two silvers – while Rio 1016 saw him stage a historic comeback (he had decided to retire after London), aged 31, to bag five gold medals and one silver.', 'He is now retired and is married to Nicole, with whom he has three sons, Boomer, Becker, and Maverick. Phelps works for his own charitable foundation, which has a particular emphasis on the mental health of children.']"

Currently ranked at world number seven, shuttler PV Sindhu remains as one of India’s biggest hopes in badminton as the nation gears up for Tokyo 2020.\xa0', 'PV Sindhu was born on July 5, 1995, in Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh to parents who were both volleyball players at the national level, with her father PV Ramana winning the bronze medal at the 1986 Seoul Asian Games. As a result, sport already coursed through her veins from the start.', 'While her parents may have been volleyball players, badminton caught PV Sindhu’s fancy after watching Pullela Gopichand in action, and by the age of eight, she was a regular at the sport.', 'The tables were soon turned, however, as Gopichand was the one in awe after watching the young PV Sindhu in action, who had joined the academy bearing his name.\xa0', 'Winning junior badminton titles like the All India Ranking Championship and the Sub-Junior Nationals, PV Sindhu made it clear she would be a player to reckon with once she made it to the international stage.', 'In 2009, PV Sindhu won the bronze medal in the sub-junior Asian Badminton Championships and a year later, she bagged singles silver in the International Badminton Challenge in Iran', 'One of the peculiarities about PV Sindhu’s career graph is her steady improvement at annual events year-by-year. This was first apparent at the 2012 Asian Junior Championships when she won the gold medal after scoring a bronze the year prior.', 'This pattern was repeated at the prestigious World Championships too. After two bronze and two silver medals between 2013 and 2018, she finally held the yellow metal in 2019 after comprehensively beating Japan’s Nozomi Okuhara 21-7, 21-7, and garnering Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s praise.', 'In her first Commonwealth Games (CWG) in 2014, PV Sindhu won bronze in women’s singles. Four years later, at the 2018 CWG in Gold Coast, she followed it up with a silver and a gold medal in the singles and mixed team badminton event respectively.', 'Her biggest achievement till date, however, remains the silver medal at Rio 2016. After eliminating Tai Tzu Ying in the round-of-16, she disposed of the second-seeded Wang Yihan and Japanese star Nozumi Okuhara in the quarter-finals and semi-finals respectively. That left her only to have to get by Spain’s Carolina Marin to win the ultimate prize.', 'While the Indian shuttler bowed down to the Spaniard’s form in all three sets, her silver medal was nonetheless an immense achievement for the nation.', 'Aside from her international success, PV Sindhu also partakes in the domestic Premier Badminton League, captaining and playing for the Hyderabad Hunters.']"
"usain-bolt"	"['Usain Bolt has been, quite simply, the face of the last three Olympic Games. To win the event’s blue riband event, the 100m, just once, guarantees Olympic immortality. To do it three times at consecutive Games, and add the 200m and 4x100m relay titles to the mix, gives him a good case to be considered the greatest athlete of all time. Still only 33, he is a living legend. Add real charm and humour to the mix, and Bolt has been the superstar that the Games needed over the last decade and a bit.', 'Bolt was born on 21 August 1986 in Sherwood Content, Jamaica. He grew up as a sports-obsessed kid, excelling in football and cricket. At high school, his cricket coach encouraged him to try athletics seriously. It was a good decision, By the age of 16, in 2002, he was world junior champion.', 'By 2007, he was the fastest man in history, setting his first 100m world record, and a year later, at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, he rose to international superstardom. In China, Bolt triumphed in the men’s 100m sprint, and then added the 200m and 4x100m title to secure a legendary triple. He broke the world record in all three events.', 'Further magic was to follow. At London 2012 he bagged the 100m again (beating his own Olympic record), added the 200m title, and then teamed up with the other Jamaican sprinters to take the 4x100m. A ‘double triple’ had been secured. That became the ‘triple triple’ at Rio 2016. Despite entering the Games not quite looking his best, Bolt once again secured all three titles – 100m, 200m and 4x100m – to make history once more.', 'Bolt had to return his 4x100m medal for Beijing 2008 after his teammate Nestor Carter was retroactively banned for a doping violation, but his personal record remains impeccable – and his sprinting record haul surely unbeatable.', 'Since his retirement in 2018, Bolt has remained extremely popular and high profile. He attempted to become a professional footballer – training with sides like Borussia Dortmund and Central Coast Mariners, as well as playing at Soccer Aid – and has got several business interests, including a new range of electric scooters.', 'Always a hit at personal appearances – he cropped up at the 2019 Super Bowl, where he equalled the fastest ever 40-yard dash – it seems like there will be a lot more to come from Bolt. The main challenge for the Olympic Games over the next decade? Finding another superstar of his stature.']"

Do not bet against her creating yet more history in Japan’s capital city.', 'Born to a Japanese mother and Haitian father, Osaka first grabbed the headlines in 2016. Aged 19, a string of fine performances secured the coveted Women’s Tour Association (WTA) Newcomer of the Year award. It was just the start.', 'After consolidating her gains in 2017, Osaka’s standout 2018 began by defeating the then-world No.1 Simona Halep on her way to a first WTA title at the prestigious Indian Wells tournament in March. Seven months later she took it to a whole new level by defeating her all-time idol Serena Williams in the final of the US Open.', 'While the match was marred by controversy, with Williams heavily penalised for an ongoing argument with the umpire, there is no doubt who the better player was. Osaka bossed it from start to finish. Despite facing Williams who was going for a record-breaking 24th grand slam title in front of her home crowd, Osaka remained unflustered throughout. A 114mph (183 km/h) service winner secured a 6-2 6-4 win and her own slice of history.', '“It was always my dream to play Serena in the US Open finals,” said Osaka, who was brought up in the USA from the age of three.', 'She was back in dreamland in her very next major. Made to work throughout, Osaka battled to the final of the 2019 Australian Open where she faced two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova. After blowing three match points in the second set, Osaka edged a thrilling third to become the first back-to-back grand slam winner in the women’s game since Jennifer Capriati in 2001. It was the type of performance that generates gold medal chat.', '“I am worried because of the high expectations from the surroundings,” Osaka said of Tokyo 2020. “But I want to play like me and get a gold medal.”']"

Having qualified for the 800m freestyle final third overall, she surprised the field by taking gold in the final by more than four seconds – and breaking an American record that had stood since 1989.', 'Going into the Rio Games, then, a lot was expected – and Ledecky didn’t disappoint. She bagged the 200m, 400m, 800m and 4x200m freestyle (two of them in World Record times), fending off incredibly tough competition from the likes of Sarah Sjostrom.', '“She’s always pursuing her personal best with fury,” says Dave Marsh, coach of the U.S. Olympic women’s team. “Where’s the fury coming from? We don’t know, but the stove is running hot.”', 'Ledecky is the current world record holder in the women’s 400m, 800m and 1500m freestyle – breaking the latter record as recently as 2018. With five Olympic golds and 15 World Championship titles, Ledecky is female swimming’s most decorated ever athlete.', 'Can she keep going, through Tokyo 2020 and Paris 2024, and truly emulate Phelps? Turning 23 this March, it’s a huge ask to maintain such levels for another two or three Olympics like Phelps – but Ledecky certainly has ambition. She is planning to race four distances in Japan, including the newly-added 1500m freestyle.', '“I have no plans of dropping anything,” she said recently about the possibility of four events being too much to manage. “Plans could change, but I think I still have a lot in me. I think I’m very experienced swimming those events. I think I know how to manage my races and manage my energy.”', 'Adding four more golds to her incredible haul of five already?

He’s the first man ever to break the 100 point mark in short program, the first to gain 200 points in free skating, and the first to get a combined total of 300.', 'He’s also the first Asian skater to win an Olympic gold, a feat he achieved aged just 19 at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games. This made him the youngest winner of the title since 1948. Hanyu then followed up that amazing performance with a gold at PyeongChang 2018.', 'How does he do it? Hanyu’s technique is simply outstanding, but he combines his ability with an astonishing creativity and artistry. He makes difficult moves like the Beillmann spin and the doughnut spin look simple, and is well known for his ability to perform complex triple Axels. He’s also thought to be the first ever figure skater to successfully land a quadruple loop in an International Skating Union sanctioned competition – a feat he pulled off in Montreal, Canada, in 2016.', 'A huge presence in Japan, he is a star of TV and film as well as arguably the country’s most famous athlete. He’s fiercely competitive - he says “to me, losing is like death” – but whether he’s going to go to Beijing 2022 remains uncertain. He answered a question about whether he’d go or not recently quite cryptically saying simply: “I managed to win twice, but the Olympics are something special. The Olympic Games are what every athlete and figure skater wants to win. Winning them makes you a true champion. I am going to look forward to thinking about who will win at the Beijing Games.""']"

On 12 October 2019, Kipchoge ran 26.2 miles in the time of 1:59:40, across a special course in Vienna, Austria. It did not count as an official marathon world record, because standard competition rules for pacing and fluids were not followed, and it wasn’t an ‘open’ race. He was paced by a car and carefully co-ordinated team of elite runners throughout.', 'But the moment still transcended the rules: the sense of occasion and Kipchoge’s emotions afterwards ensured that the completion of the 1:59 challenge, which he had already attempted and failed once, will be seen as his crowning achievement in years to come.', 'Kipchoge, now 35, realised the significance immediately afterwards. “After Roger Bannister in 1954, it took another 63 years, I tried and I did not get it,” he said about the breakthrough. “I want to inspire many people, that no human is limited.”', 'His challenge aside, Kipchoge would have gone down as the greatest marathon runner of all time, anyway. He has won 12 of the 13 marathons he’s entered during his running career, including the Rio 2016 Olympic Games marathon, and four London marathons.', 'He also holds the marathon world record for a run during competition: a blistering time of 2:01:39, set at the 2018 Berlin marathon, and knocking a huge one minute and 18 seconds off the previous record.', 'Born in the Nandi District of Kenya, he has been running at a high level since 2002, and during his earlier career specialised in the 5000m – winning bronze at the Athens 2004 Olympic Games and silver at Beijing 2008.', 'Kipchoge is married with three children. He will head to Tokyo 2020 as hot favourite for the marathon title, and the weather should certainly suit him. The race, which takes place on 9 August, has been moved out of Tokyo to Sapporo in Northern Japan due to fear about the Japanese capital’s heat – but it should still be very warm.', 'After his heroics in Vienna, Kipchoge is set to be one of the Games’ biggest stars.']"
"nadia-comaneci"	"['Nadia Comaneci achieved perfection at the age of 14. The Romanian gymnast scored a “perfect 10” on the uneven bars in the team part of the gymnastics at the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games, and even the scoreboard didn’t know what to do: it wasn’t able to display the four digits needed to show a row of 10.00s, because nobody had even conceived that it was possible.', 'Once it was proved achievable, though, she couldn’t stop doing it: Comaneci got six more perfect tens as she swept to three gold medals (all around, uneven bars and balance beam) and international superstardom.', 'She didn’t let the fact that the only way is down from there to affect her, either. Blessed with exceptional skill, balance and a clean technique, she added two more gold medals to her Montreal one at the 1980 Olympics in Moscow (balance beam and floor), and won two World Championship golds (1978 in the balance beam and 1979 in the Team) and numerous European titles.', 'She was as innovative as she was technical, once in action. On the beam, she was the first gymnast to perform an aerial walkover and an aerial cartwheel-back handspring flight series. She also debuted the double twist dismount – and the double back salto on the floor. Her willingness to put creativity and ambition alongside technical excellence continues to influence the likes of Simone Biles.', 'But things got tough after Moscow. While she did attend the Los Angeles 1984 games as a judge, she was severely restricted from leaving Romania, and found life tough after she retired from her sport. In 1989 she defected to the USA, working as a coach, businesswoman and model – and even appearing on ', '. “I don’t run away from a challenge because I am afraid,” she has said about her extraordinary life. “Instead, I run toward it because the only way to escape fear is to trample it beneath your feet.”', 'She is still deeply involved in sports: Comaneci serves as the honorary president of the Romanian Gymnastics Federation, the honorary president of the Romanian Olympic Committee, and is a member of the International Gymnastics Federation Foundation.']"

In 2015, still four months shy of his 16th birthday, he won the world under-18 title; barely two years later he had already broken the under-20 world record with a clearance of 5.90m, attracting the attention of the great Sergey Bubka.\xa0"", 'But it was another man, Renaud Lavillenie, who was Duplantis\' idol growing up after they first met in 2013.

That winter, he went to Clermont-Ferrand to train with the French Olympic champion for a few days.', ""The titles continued to follow, including European Championships gold in 2018. At that event, he cleared 6.05 metres – good enough to rank him as the fifth-best vaulter of all time. Duplantis chose to attend the Louisiana State University, but gave college up after a year to focus on his burgeoning professional athletics career. A year later at the 2019 Worlds in Doha, the Swede ended up with silver after a battle against American Sam Kendricks. But nothing quite prepared Duplantis' rivals or the world for what was to follow in early 2020."", ""Long before competitions around the world were halted by a global pandemic, Duplantis was beginning his season on the World Athletics Indoor Tour. After barely missing out at the season-opening event in Germany, the circuit rattled on to Poland where Duplantis was in scintillating form. He easily cleared three lower heights before brushing the bar on his first attempt at 6.17m. His second shot at the height, however, was good, replacing his friend and idol Lavillenie as the standard-bearer for men's pole vaulting. A week later, he added another centimetre to that height, ushering in fresh comparisons to Bubka, who broke the record 17 times."", 'Back in 2017, Duplantis confidently said: ""The goal right now, talking about the (Tokyo) Olympics, would be to win gold, I guess.

In 1935, he managed to set three world records within the space of an hour at a meeting in Michigan. It remains a feat that has never been equalled.', 'His greatest moment, however, came a year later, in a politically charged environment. Owens travelled to Berlin to take part in the 1936 Olympics – an event overseen by Adolf Hitler, which the new German chancellor hoped would profile the supremacy of the Aryan ‘master race’.', 'It wasn’t to be: the African-American Owens stole the show. He won the 100m in 10.30 seconds, the 200m in 20.70 seconds, and then the long jump, with an impressive leap of 8.06 metres – apparently after getting some advice about his run-up from a German competitor, Luz Long. His fourth gold came in the 4x100m relay, in which Owens formed a key part of the team that set a new world record of 39.80 seconds.', ""The significance of Owens’ performance has resonated through the years and has meant different things to different people.

His achievements were barely acknowledged by his own government (“Although I wasn't invited to shake hands with Hitler, I wasn't invited to the White House to shake hands with the President either”, he later said), and despite becoming famous in America, he struggled to find lucrative work. Owens became an important symbol in the struggle for equality."", 'His lasting friendship with German long jump silver medallist Long – who died in WWII fighting for the Nazi regime – was reflective of how friendships formed at the Games crossed all boundaries.', 'War denied Owens the chance to extend his Olympic legend and garner further medals – who knows what he might have achieved at a 1940 or 1944 Games.

The American can already claim to be the greatest female snowboarder of all time, and given she started so young, she could conceivably compete at another three Olympic Winter Games before she is finished.', 'Kim first burst into the public consciousness aged just 14; at the 2015 X Games, she was the youngest ever winner of a gold medal, taking the prize in the superpipe ahead of Kelly Clark. The records continued to tumble – she won X Games gold again the next year, and in the US Snowboarding Grand Prix, she became the first female boarder to land back-to-back 1080s.', 'Kim was too young to compete at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games – an event she was already talented enough to win a medal at – and therefore her first taste of Olympic action came at the Lillehammer 2016 Winter Youth Olympic Games. Kim was head and shoulders ahead of the competition, winning gold, notching the highest score in YOG snowboarding history, and acting as US team flagbearer.', 'The stage was set for PyeongChang 2018. Kim was, for many, the face of the Games. A fluent Korean speaker whose parents were first generation South Korean immigrants to the US, Kim appealed to home and overseas fans alike. She won gold in the halfpipe, with a remarkable score of 98.25 points,\xa0ten points ahead of her nearest rival. It made Kim a household name around the world, and the youngest halfpipe gold medallist. She has since been on the front of the Corn Flakes packet, been made into a Barbie doll, and starred in several films and music videos.', 'Kim, who has taken a season off, was recently admitted to Princeton University. She will begin studying science in 2023. First, however, she will defend her Olympic title. “I don’t want anyone to think I’m about to retire or anything like that. I just need some Chloe time,” she said about her break from snowboarding. “I’ve been competing at a pro level since I was 12. I wanted to kind of explore life outside of that scene for a year. I want to be in good health for the next Olympics as well as for the rest of my life, so I think this was a good decision.”']"
"ping-lang"	"['There is little doubt that Lang Ping is one of volleyball\'s greats. The Tianjin-born ""Iron Hammer"" won two Women\'s World Cups, one World Championship, and an Olympic Games gold medal as a player before becoming a widely-celebrated coach. When she led the Chinese women\'s team to gold at Rio 2016, she became the first person to win gold as both a player and a coach.', 'Lang was first selected for the Chinese national team in 1978, aged 18. Quickly becoming a mainstay of the team, the outside hitter led the Chinese team to triumph at four consecutive international championships – the 1981 and 1985 World Cups, the 1982 World Championship, and the 1984 Olympic Games. She first retired from playing in 1986, moving to the U.S. to study and coach at the University of New Mexico, but made a short return to the court a few years later during which she won World Championship silver in 1990.', ""Her first spell in charge as head coach of the Chinese team brought a World Cup bronze and World Championship and Olympic silver, earmarking her legacy as a cultural icon throughout the country. Many older Chinese still associate her name with the country's booming sports prowess in the early 1980s."", 'Lang took up a position with the U.S. national team in 2005, having agonised over the decision for three months. Public debate was fierce in China, but ultimately Lang accepted the job to be closer to her American-born daughter. ""Now China\'s volleyball coaches can be \'exported\' to coach in the U.S., a traditional sports power, it\'s an honour,"" she said. ""There are many foreign coaches in China, so what\'s so odd about Chinese coaching foreign teams?""\xa0', 'Although she kept her Chinese citizenship, Lang was criticised in some quarters as a ""traitor"" when she coached the U.S. team to a win over her homeland at Beijing 2008 en route to winning silver. But she returned to head the Chinese team in 2013, winning back those who disagreed with her decision in 2005, and success in Rio cemented her place in volleyball history.']"

Her dominance, particularly over the last couple of years, has been extraordinary – but question marks remain over whether she will keep her momentum going toward Beijing 2022, after a difficult last 12 months for the Moscow-born athlete.', 'Still just 17, the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games was the highlight of her remarkable career so far. Aged 15, she won the gold medal with an elegant, poised, but technically terrific performance.', 'Skating to ‘Don Quixote’, she was quick and precise, executing moves with ease to score 239.57 points. She landed seven triple jumps and received level-fours on her spins and step sequence. “I haven’t fully realised yet that I’ve won,” Zagitova said afterwards. “I need some time to understand that I won the Olympic Games.”', 'Those in the know about figure skating tricks and techniques enthuse about Zagitova. She has a signature move – the triple lutz-triple loop combination – that she performs flawlessly, and she is also able to pull off other ultra-hard triple loop combinations, including the triple flip. Other combinations in her repertoire include the triple futz-triple toe, double axel-triple toe, and the triple flip-double toe-double loop. She has broken four scoring world record.', 'Zagitova is also the only female skater to perform two fully back-loaded programs in the 2017-18 season, prior to the implementation of the ‘Zagitova Rule’.', 'Skating fans are waiting patiently to see whether they will see more of their hero soon. Zagotiva withdrew from contention for the 2020 Russian Championships, and did not participate in the European or World Championship events. “For me, figure skating is all about what I always worked for, and continue working for, since I was four years old,” she said before her hiatus. “Forever I will be very grateful to my coaches for the tremendous job we have done. I am not planning either to stop or retire. I am still part of team Russia and still I can take part in international competitions for team Russia. I am continuing my figure skating way with the great support from my coaches.”']"

The Panipat-born javelin thrower is a sensation.', 'He won the gold medal at the 2018 Asian Games in Jakarta, where he set a then new Indian national record of 88.06m, and was flag bearer at the opening ceremony. Neeraj Chopra has since broken his own record, throwing 88.07m at the Indian Grand Prix in 2021.', 'He also won gold at the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games, was 2016 IAAF World U20 champion, and set the world junior record, of 86.48m.\xa0', 'Neeraj Chopra will travel to the Tokyo Olympics as one of the country’s big hopes for a medal.', 'And he’s not feeling the hopes of his nation on his shoulders. “I have never taken pressure,” Neeraj Chopra said in an interview.\xa0', '“I have always tried to stay free of pressure and have fun. We train to do well on the big stage.”', 'The javelin thrower will certainly be keen to show what he can do, having missed out on qualification for the Rio 2016 Olympic Games as an up and coming young athlete.', 'When he’s not competing, Neeraj Chopra serves as a commissioned officer in the Indian armed forces. He trains with Uwe Hohn, one of the world’s most renowned coaches, and will be aiming to break the European deadlock of the sport.']"
"mikaela-shiffrin"	"['There is a strong argument to say that Mikaela Shiffrin is the most dominant athlete in any sport on the planet right now. In the 2018/19 season, Shiffrin lined up in 26 World Cup races and won 17 of them – quite an extraordinary statistic in a sport split by milliseconds and governed by weather and light, not to mention racing against 40-plus other elite-level competitors.', 'The 25-year-old ended that season as the overall, slalom, giant slalom, and super-G World Cup champion – the first time any skier has achieved the feat. She also threw in the slalom and super-G 2019 World Championship gold medals for good measure.', 'The numbers keep piling up when Shiffrin is involved. Then aged 24, she secured her 66th World Cup win in late January 2020, putting her third on the all-time list. The man at the top, legendary Swedish racer Ingemar Stenmark who has 86 victories to his name, believes that she will be the first and probably only skier to ever top a World Cup podium more than 100 times.', '“The thing I am most proud of right now is that I know how to win in slalom, [giant slalom], super-G, and downhill, which I never expected would really happen,” Shiffrin told NBC after winning her 66th World Cup race.', 'Shiffrin’s Olympic medal tally currently stands at two golds and a silver, making her the most decorated U.S. alpine skier ever. But it feels like there is more to come. At Sochi 2014 Shiffrin took the slalom title many predicted, but four years later in PyeongChang dreams of a golden sweep disappeared among high winds, a compressed schedule and nerves.', 'Yet still she won Olympic gold in a discipline she had felt unworthy to compete in on the world’s biggest stage in 2014. “Winning the gold in GS [giant slalom] in PyeongChang is probably always going to be one of my favourite moments of my career,” Shiffrin said. “Just because everything that is symbolises is everything that I hoped for.”']"

On his route to the endgame, he defeated world no.1 ranked Novak Djokovic, to become the first Asian man ever to make it to a Grand Slam tournament final. Alas, having done the hard part, he was defeated by Marin Cilic in the final. It’s the closest he’s come to real glory.', 'At Rio 2016, however, Nishikori once again demonstrated his prowess, and ability to beat the big names. The Japanese right hander lost to Andy Murray in the semi finals, but defeated Rafael Nadal 2-1 in the third place match, securing the bronze medal, and becoming the first Japanese man to win a tennis medal for 96 years. Could he go one better and take a gold medal at Tokyo 2020? It would certainly send the home fans wild.', 'Nishikori is driven by a lifelong quest to improve his game. He moved to Bradenton, Florida at the age of 14 to get the best coaching available, and has since been coached by Brad Gilbert and Michael Chang.', 'He is coming into some form, too. At the start of last season, he won the Brisbane International – his first tournament win since 2016. He was defeated in the quarter finals of the French Open by Rafa Nadal, and the quarter final of Wimbledon by Roger Federer.', 'Nishikori is largely a baseline player, with extremely consistent and fast shots on both his forehand and backhand: many rate his two handed backhand as the best on the tour. He is renowned for his return of serve, and his ability to play defensively and grind his opponents down. A supremely fit player, he relishes five-set matches: has the highest percentage of deciding set wins in the open era.', 'It could all serve him well in Tokyo. The ambition to win in his homeland can’t be questioned.', '“For me, the Olympics will be the biggest event of the year,” he says. “I want to peak for the Olympics, so I may have to change a few things to prepare properly. “Tokyo is very hot and humid in the summer, so I’ll have to be careful.”']"

The skateboarder –\xa0whose father is English, but who divides her life between living in Japan and California – decided to compete for Team GB as it would be less pressure than representing the home nation.', 'Alongside superstar skaters like Nyjah Huston (USA), Brown will be part of a new generation of athletes showcasing one of the five new sports added to the Olympic programme for Tokyo 2020.', 'Part of the International Olympic Committee’s drive to have more youth-oriented events at the Games, many are predicting that Brown can become the next Chloe Kim or Shaun White – star snowboarders who have helped legitimise their sports at the Winter Games.', '“Skateboarding is a playground,” she said recently. “I don’t really train. I don’t have a coach. I just skate. It’s nice to learn new tricks. I want to get them right for Tokyo. I’d like to do some tricks I’ve never done in a contest before.', '“I don’t feel any nerves. It will be really cool to be the youngest Olympian. People might think you’re too young or that you can’t do it, but I want to show that it’s not about your size or age. I want to be in the Olympics to inspire other girls, to show them you can do anything. I’m excited for Tokyo.”', 'Might she win a medal?

One of the most highly paid skaters ever (in terms of both prize money and sponsorships), he has also been massively influential in terms of his moves and style. He is hugely admired by his peers: Mike Mo Capaldi once said that Huston is: “probably the best skateboarder that I’ve ever seen. He does everything in, like, two tries.”', 'Having won everything there is to win in regular competitions, the rider is determined to add an Olympic gold medal to his list of honours. “That is definitely one of my ultimate goals in life,” says Huston. “But at the same time I try not to think about it too much and put too much pressure on myself because when it comes down to it, I approach all these contests the same.

First she recorded a personal best and a new national record in the women’s 100m final at the 2019 World Championships, finishing behind only the legendary Fraser-Pryce. Asher-Smith then returned to the Doha tracks days later to storm to 200m gold, smashing another British record in the process. \xa0Another silver followed in the 4x100m relay, making the 24-year-old the first Briton to win three medals at a World Championships. All that came on top of a golden sprint triple at the European Championships a year earlier.', 'After being inspired to take athletics seriously when acting as a kit carrier at the London 2012 Olympic Games, Asher-Smith was focused on the 2017 World Championships, also held in the British capital. A cruel foot injury five months out appeared to have blown that plan apart, but the sprinter had other ideas, defying doctors’ predictions to finish fourth in the 200m and grab silver in the 4x100m relay.', 'It is an attitude she summed up neatly in the opening of a Ted Talk she gave in 2018: “I’m\xa0Dina Asher-Smith\xa0and I am motivated by a fear of failure,” said the athlete who already had a Rio 2016 4x100m relay bronze medal to her name. “OK, ‘motivated’ isn’t a strong enough word to express how I feel.
